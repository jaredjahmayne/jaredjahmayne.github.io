### Role Overview
As **Chief Technical Officer (CTO)** for the Cal State Fullerton Formula SAE team, I hold primary responsibility for the technical direction of the 2026 competition vehicle. My role bridges the gap between design theory and physical manufacturing, ensuring that all sub-systems (Frame, Suspension, Powertrain, Aero) integrate seamlessly into a high-performance vehicle.

### Technical Management & Systems Integration
* **Master CAD Assembly:** Manage the top-level SolidWorks assembly, performing regular interference checks to resolve packaging conflicts between sub-teams early in the design phase.
* **Design Freeze & Timeline:** Enforce strict "Design Freeze" dates to prevent feature creep, ensuring the team transitions to manufacturing on schedule to maximize testing time.
* **Design for Manufacturing (DFM):** Implemented a mandatory DFM review policy where all components must be vetted for manufacturability and cost before approval. *If we can't make it or afford it, it doesn't go on the car.*
* **Risk Management (FMEA):** Led Failure Mode and Effects Analysis sessions to identify critical failure points and develop mitigation strategies for trackside reliability.

### Documentation & Compliance
I am responsible for the technical deliverables required for the SAE Collegiate Design Series:
* **Structural Equivalency Spreadsheet (SES):** Validate chassis safety compliance.
* **Design Report:** Author the comprehensive document justifying engineering decisions.
* **Bill of Materials (BOM):** Maintain a technical list of every part on the car for the Cost Report.

### Engineering Focus: Vehicle Dynamics
In addition to my duties as CTO, I serve as the Vehicle Dynamics Lead:
* **Suspension Design:** Defined kinematic targets and geometry to optimize tire contact patches.
* **Simulation:** Validated design goals using MATLAB and ANSYS to ensure structural integrity under 3G cornering loads.

### Testing & Safety Protocols
Developed a rigorous testing program prioritizing safety and data validation:
* **Safety Standards:** Enforced a "No-Move" policy unless a fire extinguisher, safety officer, and pre-flight checklist are present.
* **Data Logging:** Standardized testing logs to correlate static design goals with dynamic real-world data.
